# NyanPy

NyanPy is a collection of GUI applications developed in Python based on PySide6. I made this for myself (=^ãƒ»^=)

## Requirements

- Python 3.12+

- PySide6

- NumPy

- PyQtGraph

## Installation

Step 1. Install Python on your computer. For Windows, I recommend installing using Chocolatey.   

``choco install python``

``choco install pip``

Step 2. Install the dependent libraries.

``pip install numpy pyside6 pyqtgraph``

Step 3. Download this project and run the following command in the NyanPy directory. For Windows, double-click the batch file "run.bat" to start the program.

``python -m NyanPy``
